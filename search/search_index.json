The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The resource determines the behavior of the controller. The controller periodically adjusts the number of replicas in a replication controller or deployment to match the observed average CPU utilization to the target specified by user Prerequisites Metrics Server . This needs to be setup if you are using kubeadm etc. and replaces heapster starting with kubernetes version 1.8. Resource Requests and Limits. Defining CPU as well as Memory requirements for containers in Pod Spec is a must Deploying Metrics Server Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler along with kubectl top command depends on the core monitoring data such as cpu and memory utilization which is scraped and provided by kubelet, which comes with in built cadvisor component. Earlier, you would have to install a additional component called heapster in order to collect this data and feed it to the hpa controller. Starting with 1.8 version of Kubernetes, this behavior is changed, and now metrics-server would provide this data. Metric server is being included as a essential component for kubernetes cluster, and being incroporated into kubernetes to be included out of box. It stores the core monitoring information using in-memory data store. If you try to pull monitoring information using the following commands kubectl top pod kubectl top node it does not show it, rather gives you a error message similar to [output] Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource (get services http:heapster:) Even though the error mentions heapster, its replaced with metrics server by default now.

List the control plane pods If your nodes are up and running, next thing to check is the status of Kubernetes components. Run, kubectl get pods -n kube-system If any of the pod is restarting or crashing , look in to the issue. This can be done by getting the pod's description.

This requires two different redis cofigurations , which needs to be described in one Pod template. This complexity can be resolved by using init containers. These init containers copy the appropriate redis configuration by analysing the hostname of the pod. If the Pod's (host)name has 0 as Ordinal number , then it is choosen as the master and master.conf is copied to /etc/ directory. Every other pod will be configured as a replica with slave.conf as configuration. file: redis-sts.yml [...] initContainers: - name: init-redis image: redis:4.0.9 command: - bash - \"-c\" - | set -ex # Generate mysql server-id from pod ordinal index.

Nano Project: Configuring persistent volume claim per instance of redis Similar to databases, each redis instance needs its own data store, which should also be persistent. Current code that you have applied uses emptyDir as the volume type. This is a problem as emptyDir gets deleted when the pod is deleted, and is not persistent. Your task is to update the YAML file for the statefulset with the following changes, use volumeClaimTemplate instead of volumes for volume redis-data . This will ensure a persistentVolumeClaim per replica/pod. All other volumes remain unchanged. Provide the storageClass as NFS, a provisioner for which is already been configured Size of the volume could be 200Mi as its just a key value store used by the instavote app to store the votes. accessModes should be ReadWriteOnce as the volumes for redis should not be shared between multiple instances. Update the statefulSet, apply and validate that persistentVolumeClaim and persistentVolume are created for each instance/pod of redis application.

But this chapter explains some advanced topics related to pod scheduling. From the api document for version 1.11 following are the pod specs which are relevant from scheduling perspective. nodeSelector nodeName affinity schedulerName tolerations nodeName You could bind a pod to a specific node with a name using nodeName spec. Lets take an example where you want to run the deployment for result service on a specific node. Lets look at how you would do it, Begin by listing the nodes kubectl get nodes [sample output] NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION kind-control-plane Ready control-plane 35h v1.29.2 kind-worker Ready <none> 35h v1.29.2 kind-worker2 Ready <none> 35h v1.29.2 Now, bind your pod to one node e.g. kind-worker by modyfying the deployment spec as: File : result-deploy.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment .... ..... spec: containers: - image: schoolofdevops/vote-result name: vote-result nodeName: kind-worker apply and validate kubectl apply -f result-deploy.yaml kubectl get pods -o wide nodeSelector Using nodeSelector instead of directly specifying nodeName in Kubernetes offers greater flexibility and resilience in scheduling pods. While nodeName forces a pod to schedule on a specific node, effectively bypassing Kubernetes' scheduler, nodeSelector allows for more dynamic placement by specifying a set of criteria that nodes must meet for the pod to be scheduled there. This approach utilizes Kubernetes' intelligent scheduling capabilities, enabling the system to consider multiple suitable nodes that meet the specified labels. This not only improves fault tolerance by avoiding dependencies on a single node but also facilitates more efficient resource utilization across the cluster. Additionally, nodeSelector supports scenarios where the environment might change, such as when nodes are added or removed, or their labels are updated, ensuring that the pods can still be scheduled according to the current state of the cluster. To use nodeSelector, begin by labeling your nodes as: kubectl get nodes --show-labels kubectl label nodes <node-name> zone=aaa kubectl get nodes --show-labels e.g. kubectl label nodes kind-worker zone=aaa kubectl label nodes kind-worker2 zone=bbb kubectl get nodes --show-labels where, replace kind-worker and kind-worker2 can be the the actual nodes in your cluster. Now update one of the deployments and add the nodeSelector spec to the pod e.g. File : result-deploy.yaml spec: containers: - image: schoolofdevops/vote-result name: vote-result nodeSelector: zone: bbb Note: ensure you have removed nodeName if present. apply and validate kubectl apply -f result-deploy.yaml kubectl get pods -o wide You shall see the pod being recreated now on the node matching the label selected using nodeSelector. Affinity and Anti-Affinity We have discussed about scheduling a pod on a particular node using NodeSelector . Using affinity and anti-affinity in Kubernetes offers a more sophisticated and granular level of control compared to nodeSelector, enabling not just simple label matching but also complex rules that govern pod placement. Affinity rules allow you to specify preferences that attract pods to certain nodes, either based on the node's properties or other pods that are already running on those nodes. Conversely, anti-affinity rules are used to ensure pods are spread across different nodes or node groups, enhancing high availability and reducing the risk of simultaneous failures. This is particularly useful in large-scale deployments where maintaining workload balance and resilience is crucial. For example, you can ensure that multiple instances of a service run in different racks or availability zones, minimizing potential impact from physical infrastructure failures. These features allow Kubernetes to more effectively manage the distribution and redundancy of workloads, which is vital for maintaining robust, scalable applications.

While nodeName forces a pod to schedule on a specific node, effectively bypassing Kubernetes' scheduler, nodeSelector allows for more dynamic placement by specifying a set of criteria that nodes must meet for the pod to be scheduled there. This approach utilizes Kubernetes' intelligent scheduling capabilities, enabling the system to consider multiple suitable nodes that meet the specified labels. This not only improves fault tolerance by avoiding dependencies on a single node but also facilitates more efficient resource utilization across the cluster. Additionally, nodeSelector supports scenarios where the environment might change, such as when nodes are added or removed, or their labels are updated, ensuring that the pods can still be scheduled according to the current state of the cluster. To use nodeSelector, begin by labeling your nodes as: kubectl get nodes --show-labels kubectl label nodes <node-name> zone=aaa kubectl get nodes --show-labels e.g. kubectl label nodes kind-worker zone=aaa kubectl label nodes kind-worker2 zone=bbb kubectl get nodes --show-labels where, replace kind-worker and kind-worker2 can be the the actual nodes in your cluster. Now update one of the deployments and add the nodeSelector spec to the pod e.g. File : result-deploy.yaml spec: containers: - image: schoolofdevops/vote-result name: vote-result nodeSelector: zone: bbb Note: ensure you have removed nodeName if present. apply and validate kubectl apply -f result-deploy.yaml kubectl get pods -o wide You shall see the pod being recreated now on the node matching the label selected using nodeSelector.","title":"nodeSelector"},{"location":"advanced_pod_scheduling/#affinity-and-anti-affinity","text":"We have discussed about scheduling a pod on a particular node using NodeSelector . Using affinity and anti-affinity in Kubernetes offers a more sophisticated and granular level of control compared to nodeSelector, enabling not just simple label matching but also complex rules that govern pod placement. Affinity rules allow you to specify preferences that attract pods to certain nodes, either based on the node's properties or other pods that are already running on those nodes. Conversely, anti-affinity rules are used to ensure pods are spread across different nodes or node groups, enhancing high availability and reducing the risk of simultaneous failures. This is particularly useful in large-scale deployments where maintaining workload balance and resilience is crucial. For example, you can ensure that multiple instances of a service run in different racks or availability zones, minimizing potential impact from physical infrastructure failures. These features allow Kubernetes to more effectively manage the distribution and redundancy of workloads, which is vital for maintaining robust, scalable applications.

NodePort is best suited for development environment(debugging). Not suited for production use. LoadBalancer Normal cloud load balancer. Exposes service to outside world.

That is ., * ExternalIP Cluster IP and DNS ClusterIP is internal to the cluster. ClusterIP is provided by default. If you do not define the type of the service, then the service is configured with a clusterIP. A typical service type of clusterIP looks like, File: frontend-svc.yml apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: front-end namespace: instavote labels: app: front-end env: dev spec: selector: app: front-end ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8079 type: ClusterIP NodePort Exposes a port on node within 30000 to 32767 range.

Let us see an example. Let us consider a scenario where you have your redis cluster hosted outside the cluster. Your backend in cluster need to use this redis cluster. In this case, you will create a service with ExternalName, which is nothing but a CNAME record of your redis cluster. This type of services will neither have any ports defined nor have any selectors. But, how do you make sure the backend pods uses this service? For that, you will create a custom endpoint, in which map your service to specific endpoints.

Ingress Ingress controller is an Kubernetes object that manages external access to the backend services. This is the preferred way of exposing your services. Ingress Controller To use an ingress resource, an ingress controller (ex. nginx, traefik) must be running. This controller has to be deployed manually.

You need access to the folllwing files on kubernetes master. Certificate : ca.crt (kubeadm) or ca.key (kubespray) Pricate Key : ca.key (kubeadm) or ca-key.pem (kubespray) You would typically find it the following paths /etc/kubernetes/pki To verify which one is your cert and which one is key, use the following command, $ file /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt ca.pem: PEM certificate $ file /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key ca-key.pem: PEM RSA private key Once signed, .csr files with added signatures become the certificates that could be used to authenticate.

The Flask application ( schoolofdevops/s3checker:latest ) will check access to an S3 bucket and create a file in it to verify permissions. Why Use IRSA? IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) provides a way to securely assign AWS IAM roles to Kubernetes pods running on Amazon EKS. This allows your application to assume IAM roles and access AWS resources without needing to manage AWS credentials directly. This improves security by leveraging temporary credentials managed by AWS and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information. +---------------------+ | AWS IAM | | +----------------+ | | | IAM Role | | | | (S3AccessRole) | | | +-------+--------+ | | | | | | | +----------|----------+ | | Assumes role v +---------------------+ | Amazon EKS Cluster | | +----------------+ | | | Service Account| | | | (s3-access-sa) | | | +-------+--------+ | | | | | | | +----------|----------+ | | Bound to v +----------------------------+ | EKS Pod | | +------------------------+ | | | Flask App Container | | | | (schoolofdevops/ | | | | s3checker:latest) | | | +---------+--------------+ | | | | | | | +-----------|----------------+ | | Uses IRSA v +----------------------------+ | AWS S3 Bucket | | (your-s3-bucket-name) | | | | - ListBucket | | - PutObject | | - GetObject | +----------------------------+ AWS IAM Role Creation : An IAM role ( S3AccessRole ) is created with a policy that allows access to the S3 bucket ( your-s3-bucket-name ). IAM Role Association with EKS Service Account : The IAM role is associated with a Kubernetes service account ( s3-access-sa ) in the EKS cluster. This is done using eksctl which sets up the necessary trust relationship. EKS Pod Deployment : A Kubernetes pod running the Flask application ( schoolofdevops/s3checker:latest ) is deployed in the EKS cluster. This pod uses the service account ( s3-access-sa ) which is annotated with the IAM role. IRSA Mechanism : The pod assumes the IAM role ( S3AccessRole ) through the service account ( s3-access-sa ). This is facilitated by the IRSA mechanism, which uses Kubernetes service account tokens and AWS STS (Security Token Service) to issue temporary credentials to the pod. Access S3 Bucket : The Flask application running inside the pod uses the temporary credentials obtained via IRSA to access the S3 bucket ( your-s3-bucket-name ). The application can list, put, and get objects in the bucket as per the IAM policy. \u2800 By using IRSA, the application running in the EKS pod can securely access AWS resources without embedding long-term AWS credentials in the application code or environment variables. Instead, it leverages temporary credentials that are managed and rotated by AWS.

Quick Setup: With a single command, you can create a fully functioning EKS cluster. 3. Default Best Practices: It follows AWS best practices for cluster creation and configuration. 4. Less Code: Requires fewer commands and less code to manage the cluster. \u2800 Cons: 1. Less Granular Control: While it simplifies many tasks, it might abstract away some of the details, giving you less control over specific configurations. 2. Dependency: Adds an additional dependency that students need to install and manage. \u2800 aws cli with kubectl Pros: 1. Granular Control: Provides more control over the EKS cluster configuration and setup, allowing for fine-tuning and customization. 2. Learning Opportunity: Teaches students more about the underlying AWS services and Kubernetes configurations. 3. Versatility: aws cli and kubectl are versatile tools that can be used for a wide range of AWS and Kubernetes operations beyond just cluster creation. Cons: 1. Complexity: Requires more steps and a deeper understanding of AWS and Kubernetes concepts, which might be overwhelming for beginners. 2. More Commands: Involves writing more commands and scripts, which can be error-prone. As part of this lab, you will take a simpler approach and use eksctl to quickly create a cluster. Create VPC with Public Subnets EKS needs a VPC to launch itself in. There are three different options while creating the VPCs as follows VPC with Public and Private Subnets VPC with only Public Subnets VPC with only Private Subnets While you would ideally create VPC with public and private subnets so that you could host your applications in private subnets and set up load balancers and ingress controllers in public, as part of this lab guide, you are going to set up VPC with public subnets only. This is to avoid creation of two NAT Gateways, which would incur additional costs. The VPC that you are going to create has three public subnets that are deployed into different Availability Zones in an AWS Region. All nodes are automatically assigned public IPv4 addresses and can send and receive internet traffic through an internet gateway . A security group is deployed that denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. The subnets are tagged so that Kubernetes can deploy load balancers to them. If you choose to create a VPC with a different configuration, please pick a relevant template from Creating a VPC for your Amazon EKS cluster . \u2800 To create your VPC Open the AWS CloudFormation console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation . From the navigation bar, select an AWS Region that supports EKS e.g. Singapore . Choose Create stack , With new resources (standard) . From Prepare Temaplte, select Choose and existing template and Under Template source , select Amazon S3 URL . Paste the following URL into the text area under Amazon S3 URL and choose Next : https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/cloudformation/2020-10-29/amazon-eks-vpc-sample.yaml On the Specify Details page, enter the stack name e.g. eks-vpc-01 and update parameters if you want to change any, and then choose Next and create VPC stack. Proceed to Review and create and submit the stack. It takes a few minutes to have the status change from to once VPC is created, you could verify everything from VPC console. Also note down the VpcId and SubnetIds from the Outputs . Configure IAM Role for EKS Step 1: Create the IAM Role Open the IAM Console : Go to the IAM console . Create a Role : Click on Roles and then Create role . Choose EKS as the service that will use this role. Select the EKS - Cluster use case. From Add Permissions page you will see the following policy already attached: AmazonEKSClusterPolicy Select Next From Name, review and create page , provide a Role name e.g. EKSClusterServiceRole and proceed to Create role . From IAM Console -> Roles search for EKSClusterServiceRole and select it. From Permissions tab, Add Permissions dropdown, Choose Attach policies. Search for AmazonEKSVPCResourceController and attach it to the role. Set the Trust Relationship : Ensure the trust relationship for the role allows EKS to assume the role. The trust policy should look like this: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"eks.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] } This should already be there. Verify it from the Trust relationships tab. \u2800 Note down the role ARN e.g. arn:aws:iam::665496447754:role/EKSClusterServiceRole which you would add to cluster configuration later. Also note the new policy being added to the role. Launch EKS Cluster with eksctl Start with eksctl eksctl info Create cluster configurarion as follows.

Using a mount point directly as the data directory is not recommended. Create a subdirectory under the mount point. The database cluster will be initialized with locale \"en_US.utf8\". The default database encoding has accordingly been set to \"UTF8\". The default text search configuration will be set to \"english\". Data page checksums are disabled. This is happening because the EBS volume created comes with lost+found directory, which needs to be cleaned up before starting the database. To do that, you could add a init container to existing deployment as File : db-deploy-pvc.yaml .... spec: initContainers: - name: init-pg-data image: busybox:latest command: ['sh', '-c', 'rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*'] volumeMounts: - name: db-vol mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data containers: - image: postgres:9.4 imagePullPolicy: Always name: db env: - name: POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD value: trust You need to add the initContainer block inside the spec, at the same level as existing container block. apply the changes kubectl apply -f db-deploy-pvc.yaml and you should now see the pod running, this time with a EBS volume NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/db-7b7fd4bcc7-z7zdr 1/1 Running 0 47s You should also see the EBS volume been provisionined and attached on the same EC2 instance that is running the db pod.

The default database encoding has accordingly been set to \"UTF8\". The default text search configuration will be set to \"english\". Data page checksums are disabled.

Here's a detailed step-by-step process to get your Helm charts published using GitHub Pages: Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository Create a New Repository : If you don't already have one, create a new GitHub repository. It can be named anything, but something like helm-charts is descriptive and common. Step 2: Clone Your Repository Locally cd~ git clone https://github.com/xxxxxx/helm-charts.git cd helm-charts Replace <username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with the name of your repository. Step 3: Package Your Helm Chart Assuming you have your chart directory for instavote ready, move that inside the helm-charts e.g. mv instavote helm-charts/ cd helm-charts git add instavote/ git commit -am \"added instavote chart\" git push origin main git log helm package instavote ls This command will create a .tgz file of your chart. Step 4: Create or Update the Helm Chart Repository Index After packaging your chart, create an index file that Helm can use to fetch chart metadata: helm repo index . --url https://xxxxxx.github.io/helm-charts/ This command generates or updates an index.yaml file with information about charts stored in the directory. Step 5: Switch to the gh-pages Branch If the gh-pages branch does not exist, create it and switch to it: git checkout --orphan gh-pages git status git rm -rf instavote README.md Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes git add *.tgz index.yaml git commit -m \"Publish Helm charts\" git push origin gh-pages Step 7: Ensure GitHub Pages is Set Up Correctly Go to your repository's settings. Find the \"Pages\" section. Set the source to the gh-pages branch (you may need to create this branch in your repository if it doesn't exist yet). Step 8: Add Your Repository to Helm Now that your chart is published, you can add your repository to Helm: helm repo add instavote https://xxxxxx.github.io/helm-charts/ Step 9: Update Helm Repositories helm repo list helm repo update This will update your local Helm client with the latest charts from your newly published repository. Step 10: Installing Charts You and others can now install charts from your repository: helm search repo instavote helm install instavote instavote/instavote Replace <release-name> with a name for your Helm deployment and <chart-name> with the name of the chart in your repository.

Exposing a Service with ExternalIPs Observe the output of service list, specifically note the EXTERNAL-IP colum in the output. kubectl get svc Now, update the service spec and add external IP configs. Pick IP addresses of any two nodes (You could add one or more) and it to the spec as, kubectl edit svc vote [sample file edit] --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: vote labels: role: vote spec: selector: role: vote ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 80 nodePort: 30000 type: NodePort externalIPs: - xx.xx.xx.xx - yy.yy.yy.yy Where replace xx.xx.xx.xx and yy.yy.yy.yy with IP addresses of the nodes on two of the kubernetes hosts. apply kubectl get svc kubectl apply -f vote-svc.yaml kubectl get svc kubectl describe svc vote [sample output] NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE vote NodePort 10.107.71.204 206.189.150.190,159.65.8.227 80:30000/TCP 11m where, EXTERNAL-IP column shows which IPs the application is been exposed on. You could go to http:// : to access this application. e.g. http://206.189.150.190:80 where you should replace 206.189.150.190 with the actual IP address of the node that you exposed this on. Internal Service Discovery Kubernetes not only allows you to publish external facing apps with the services, but also allows you to discover other components of your application stack with the clusterIP and DNS attached to it. Before you begin adding service discovery, Visit the vote app from browser Attempt to vote by clicking on one of the options observe what happens. Does it go through? Debugging, kubectl get pod kubectl exec vote-xxxx nslookup redis [replace xxxx with the actual pod id of one of the vote pods ] keep the above command on a watch. You should create a new terminal to run the watch command. e.g. kubectl exec -it vote-xxxx sh watch kubectl exec vote-xxxx ping redis where, vote-xxxx is one of the vote pods that I am running. Replace this with the actual pod id. Now create redis service kubectl apply -f redis-svc.yaml kubectl get svc kubectl describe svc redis Watch the nslookup screen and observe if its able to resolve redis by hostname and its pointing to an IP address. e.g. Name: redis Address 1: 10.104.111.173 redis.instavote.svc.cluster.local where 10.104.111.173 is the ClusterIP assigned to redis service redis.instavote.svc.cluster.local is the dns attached to the ClusterIP above What happened here? Service redis was created with a ClusterIP e.g. 10.102.77.6 A DNS entry was created for this service. The fqdn of the service is redis.instavote.svc.cluster.local and it takes the form of my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local Each pod points to internal DNS server running in the cluster. You could see the details of this by running the following commands kubectl exec vote-xxxx cat /etc/resolv.conf [replace vote-xxxx with actual pod id] [sample output] nameserver 10.96.0.10 search instavote.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local options ndots:5 where 10.96.0.10 is the ClusterIP assigned to the DNS service. You could co relate that with, kubectl get svc -n kube-system NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kube-dns ClusterIP 10.96.0.10 <none> 53/UDP,53/TCP 1h kubernetes-dashboard NodePort 10.104.42.73 <none> 80:31000/TCP 23m where, 10.96.0.10 is the ClusterIP assigned to kube-dns and matches the configuration in /etc/resolv.conf above. Creating Endpoints for Redis Service is been created, but you still need to launch the actual pods running redis application. Create the endpoints now, kubectl apply -f redis-deploy.yaml kubectl describe svc redis [sample output] Name: redis Namespace: instavote Labels: role=redis tier=back Annotations: kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration={\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"kind\":\"Service\",\"metadata\":{\"annotations\":{},\"labels\":{\"role\":\"redis\",\"tier\":\"back\"},\"name\":\"redis\",\"namespace\":\"instavote\"},\"spec\"...

Try to vote, see if that works? Why ? Enabling communication between pods in the same namespace When you tried to vote, you might have observed that it does not work. Thats because the default network policy we created earlier blocks all outgoing traffic. Which is good for securing the environment, however you still need to provide inter connection between services from the same project. Specifically vote , worker and results apps need outgoing connection to redis and db . Lets allow that with a egress policy. +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | | | +------------+ +-----------+ | =====> | results | ------>| db | | | | | | | <-------+ | | +------------+ +-----------+ | | | | | | | | | +----+----+---+ | | | worker | | | | | | | +----+--------+ | | | | | | | | +----------+ +-----------+ | | | | vote | | redis | <-------+ | =====> | | ------> | | | | +----------+ +-----------+ | | | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ Edit the same policy file and add the following snippet, file: instavote-netpol.yaml apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: default namespace: instavote spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Ingress - Egress ingress: - from: - podSelector: {} # Allows all pods within the same namespace egress: - to: - podSelector: {} # Allows all pods within the same namespace --- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: public-ingress namespace: instavote spec: podSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: role, operator: In, values: [vote, result]} policyTypes: - Ingress ingress: - {} where, instavote-egress is a new network policy which, defines policy for pods with vote , worker and results role and allows them outgoing access to any pods in the same namespace, and that includes redis and db Troubleshooting Exercise Applying the above policy has no effect on the communication between vote and redis applications. You could validate this by loading the vote app and submit a vote. It should not work. There is a problem in the network policy file above. Analyse the policies, compare them against the kubernetes api reference document, understand how its being applied and see if you could fix this problem. Your task is to ensure that vote and redis apps are communicating with one another. Solution The reason why communication between vote and redis is broken is because of the name resoulution (DNS Based Service Discovery) is broken. This is because the network policies that you have set up do not allow the services in instavote namespace to communicate to even the DNS server in the cluster running in kube-system namespace. You could allow this by adding one more policiy.

We will also learn what it means to run a container, its lifecycle and perform basic operations such as creating, starting, stopping, removing, pausing containers and checking the status etc. Using docker cli We can use docker cli to interact with docker daemon. Various functions of docker command is given below. Try this yourself by runnig $sudo docker command docker [Output] Usage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...] docker [ --help | -v | --version ] A self-sufficient runtime for containers.

Namely, docker version docker -v docker system info The docker system info command gives a lot of useful information like total number of containers and images along with information about host resource utilization etc. Stream events from the docker daemon Docker events serves us with the stream of events or interactions that are happening with the docker daemon. This does not stream the log data of application inside the container. That is done by docker logs command. Let us see how this command works Open an another terminal. Let us call the old terminal as Terminal 1 and the newer one as Terminal 2 . From Terminal 1, execute docker events . Now you are getting the data stream from docker daemon docker system events Launching our first container Now we have a basic understanding of docker command and sub commands, let us dive straight into launching our very first container docker run alpine:3.4 uptime Where, we are using docker client to run a application/command uptime using an image by name alpine:3.4 [Output] Unable to find image 'alpine:3.4' locally 3.4: Pulling from library/alpine 81033e7c1d6a: Pull complete Digest: sha256:2532609239f3a96fbc30670716d87c8861b8a1974564211325633ca093b11c0b Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:3.4 15:24:34 up 7:36, load average: 0.00, 0.03, 0.04 What happened? This command will Pull the alpine image file from docker hub , a cloud registry Create a runtime environment/ container with the above image Launch a program (called uptime ) inside that container Stream that output to the terminal Stop the container once the program is exited Where did my container go? docker container ps docker container ps -l The point here to remember is that, when that executable stops running inside the container, the container itself will stop. Let's see what happens when we run that command again, [Output] docker run alpine uptime 07:48:06 up 3:15, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 Now docker no longer pulls the image again from registry, because it has stored the image locally from the previous run. So once an image is pulled, we can make use of that image to create and run as many container as we want without the need of downloading the image again. However it has created a new instance of the iamge/container. Checking Status of the containers We have understood how docker run commands works. But what if you want to see list of running containers and history of containers that had run and exited? This can be done by executing the following commands docker ps [Output] CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES This command doesn't give us any information. Because, docker ps command will only show list of container(s) which are running docker ps -l [Output] CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 988f4d90d604 alpine \"uptime\" About a minute ago Exited (0) About a minute ago fervent_hypatia the -l flag shows the last run container along with other details like image it used, command it executed, return code of that command, etc., docker ps -n 2 [Output] NAMES 988f4d90d604 alpine \"uptime\" About a minute ago Exited (0) About a minute ago fervent_hypatia acea3023dca4 alpine \"uptime\" 3 minutes ago Exited (0) 3 minutes ago mad_darwin Docker gives us the flexibility to show the desirable number of last run containers.

Running Containers in Interactive Mode We can interact with docker containers by giving -it flags at the run time. These flags stand for * i - Interactive * t - tty docker run -it alpine:3.4 sh [Output] Unable to find image 'alpine:3.4' locally latest: Pulling from library/alpine ff3a5c916c92: Already exists Digest: sha256:7df6db5aa61ae9480f52f0b3a06a140ab98d427f86d8d5de0bedab9b8df6b1c0 Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest / # As you see, we have landed straight into sh shell of that container. This is the result of using -it flags and mentioning that container to run the sh shell. Don't try to exit that container yet. We have to execute some other commands in it to understand the next topic Namespaced: Like a full fledged OS, Docker container has its own namespaces This enables Docker container to isolate itself from the host as well as other containers Run the following commands and see that alpine container has its own namespaces and not inheriting much from host OS NAMESPACED [Run the following commands inside the container] cat /etc/issue ps aux ifconfig hostname Shared(NON NAMESPACED): We have understood that containers have their own namespaces. But will they share something to some extent? the answer is YES . Let's run the following commands on both the container and the host machine [Run the following commands inside the container] uptime uname -a cat /proc/cpuinfo date free As you can see, the container uses the same Linux Kernel from the host machine. Just like uname command, the following commands share the same information as well. In order to avoid repetition, we will see the output of container alone. Now exit out of that container by running exit or by pressing ctrl+d Making Containers Persist Running Containers in Detached Mode So far, we have run the containers interactively. But this is not always the case. Sometimes you may want to start a container without interacting with it. This can be achieved by using \"detached mode\" ( -d ) flag. Hence the container will launch the deafault application inside and run in the background. This saves a lot of time, we don't have to wait till the applications launches successfully. It will happen behind the screen. Let us run the following command to see this in action [Command] docker run -idt schoolofdevops/loop program -d , --detach : detached mode [Output] 2533adf280ac4838b446e4ee1151f52793e6ac499d2e631b2c752459bb18ad5f This will run the container in detached mode.

Launching a container with a pre built app image To launch vote container run the following command. Don't bother about the new flag -P now. We will explain about that flag later in this chapter docker container run -idt -P schoolofdevops/vote [Output] Unable to find image 'schoolofdevops/vote:latest' locally latest: Pulling from schoolofdevops/vote Digest: sha256:9195942ea654fa8d8aeb37900be5619215c08e7e1bef0b7dfe4c04a9cc20a8c2 Status: Downloaded newer image for schoolofdevops/vote:latest 7d58ecc05754b5fd192c4ecceae334ac22565684c6923ea332bff5c88e3fca2b Lets check the status of the container docker ps -l [Output] CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 7d58ecc05754 schoolofdevops/vote \"gunicorn app:app -b\u2026\" 27 seconds ago Up 26 seconds 0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp peaceful_varahamihira Renaming the container We can rename the container by using following command docker rename 7d58ecc05754 vote [replace 7d58ecc05754 with the actual container id on your system ] We have changed container's automatically generated name to vote . This new name can be of your choice. The point to understand is this command takes two arguments. The Old_name followed by New_name Run docker ps command to check the effect of changes docker ps [Output] CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 7d58ecc05754 schoolofdevops/vote \"gunicorn app:app -b\u2026\" 3 minutes ago Up 3 minutes 0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp vote As you can see here, the container is renamed to vote . This makes referencing container in cli very much easier. Ready to vote ? Let's see what this vote application does by connecting to that application. For that we need, Host machine's IP Container's port which is mapped to a host's port Let's find out the port mapping of container to host. Docker provides subcommand called port which does this job docker port vote [Output] 80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32768 So whatever traffic the host gets in port 2368 will be mapped to container's port 32768 Let's connect to http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT to see the actual application Finding Everything about the running container This topic discusses about finding metadata of containers. These metadata include various parameters like, * State of the container * Mounts * Configuration * Network, etc., Inspecting Lets try this inspect subcommand in action docker inspect vote Data output by above command contains detailed descriptino of the container an its properties. is represented in JSON format which makes filtering these results easier. Copying files between container and client host We can copy files/directories form host to container and vice-versa Let us create a file on the host touch testfile To copy the testfile from host machine to ghsot contanier , try docker cp testfile vote:/opt This command will copy testfile to vote container's /opt directory and will not give any output. To verify the file has been copies or not, let us log into container by running, docker exec -it vote bash Change directory into /opt and list the files cd /opt ls [Output] testfile There you can see that file has been successfully copied. Now exit the container Now you may try to cp some files from the container to the host machine docker cp vote:/app . ls Checking the Stats Docker stats command returns a data stream of resource utilization used by containers. The flag --no-stream disables data stream and displays only first result docker stats --no-stream=true vote docker stats Controlling Resources Docker provides us the granularity to control each container's resource utilization . We have several commands in the inventory to achieve this Putting limits on Running Containers First, let us monitor the utilization docker stats You can see that Memory attribute has max as its value, which means unlimited usage of host's RAM. We can put a cap on that by using update command docker update --memory 400M --memory-swap -1 vote [Output] vote Let us check whether the change has taken effect or not with docker stats terminal docker stat As you can see, the memory utilization of the container is changed from xxxx (unlimited) to 400 mb Limiting Resources while launching new containers The following resources can be limited using the update command * CPU * Memory * Disk IO * Capabilities Open two terminals, lets call them T1, and T2 In T1, start monitoring the stats docker stats [Output] CONTAINER CPU % MEM USAGE / LIMIT MM % NET I/O BLOCK I/O PIDS b28efeef41f8 0.16% 190.1 MiB / 400 MiB 47.51% 1.296 kB / 648 B 86.02 kB / 45.06 kB 0 CONTAINER CPU % MEM USAGE / LIMIT MEM % NET I/O BLOCK I/O PIDS b28efeef41f8 0.01% 190.1 MiB / 400 MiB 47.51% 1.296 kB / 648 B 86.02 kB / 45.06 kB 0 From T2, launch containers with different CPU shares as well as cpus configurations.

They make sure that our application is ready to receive and process user requests. In Kubernetes we have two types of health checks, * Liveness Probe * Readiness Probe Probes are simply a diagnostic action performed by the kubelet. There are three types actions a kubelet perfomes on a pod, which are namely, ExecAction : Executes a command inside the pod. Assumed successful when the command returns 0 as exit code. TCPSocketAction : Checks for a state of a particular port on the pod. Considered successful when the state of the port is open . HTTPGetAction : Performs a GET request on pod's IP. Assumed successful when the status code is greater than 200 and less than 400 In cases of any failure during the diagnostic action, kubelet will report back to the API server. Let us study about how these health checks work in practice. Adding Liveness/Readineess Probes Liveness probe checks the status of the pod(whether it is running or not). If livenessProbe fails, then the pod is subjected to its restart policy. The default state of livenessProbe is Success . Readiness probe checks whether your application is ready to serve the requests. When the readiness probe fails, the pod's IP is removed from the end point list of the service.

They make sure that our application is ready to receive and process user requests. In Kubernetes we have two types of health checks, * Liveness Probe * Readiness Probe Probes are simply a diagnostic action performed by the kubelet. There are three types actions a kubelet perfomes on a pod, which are namely, ExecAction : Executes a command inside the pod. Assumed successful when the command returns 0 as exit code. TCPSocketAction : Checks for a state of a particular port on the pod. Considered successful when the state of the port is open . HTTPGetAction : Performs a GET request on pod's IP. Assumed successful when the status code is greater than 200 and less than 400 In cases of any failure during the diagnostic action, kubelet will report back to the API server.

This will allow you to deploy and test your code in production, safely, with a subset of your users. Whats the differnce between Canary and A/B Testing ? Well, with canary, you could typically choose which subset of clients you would want to send to the newer versions, based on some criteria, such as client name, user name, type of device, certain specific header etc. A/B testing is simpler version of Canary, where the subset of clients redirected to the new version randomly e.g. 20% of the total traffic going to v2, remaining to v1. This could be easily achieved with Kubernetes using the method described here. Canary needs more advanced configurations, typically lacking with kubernetes, and thats where you may want to consider using a service mesh such as Istio. cd k8s-code/projets/instavote/dev mkdir ab cp vote-deploy.yaml ab/vote-ab-deploy.yaml change the following fields in vote-ab-deploy.yaml metadata.name: vote-ab spec.replicas: 3 spec.selector.matchExpressions: - {key: version, operator: Exists template.metadata.labels.version: v4 template.spec.containers.image: schoolofdevops/vote:v4 File: ab/frontend-ab-deploy.yml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: vote-ab spec: strategy: type: RollingUpdate rollingUpdate: maxSurge: 2 maxUnavailable: 1 revisionHistoryLimit: 4 paused: false replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: role: vote matchExpressions: - {key: version, operator: Exists} minReadySeconds: 40 template: metadata: name: vote labels: app: python role: vote version: v4 spec: containers: - name: app image: schoolofdevops/vote:v4 ports: - containerPort: 80 protocol: TCP Before creating this deployment, find out how many endpoints the service has, kubectl describe service/vote [sample output ] Endpoints: 10.32.0.10:80,10.32.0.11:80,10.32.0.4:80 + 12 more...

Case for Service Mesh When kubernetes offers ways to create Blue/Green release strategy, do zero down time deployments, implement A/B Testing, why do you need Service Mesh ? Well here are a few reasons * Kubernetes does not support Canary out of the box. you could get close by achieving A/B Testing, but still a canary release would be useful in many cases. * Even though you could create A/B testing and Blue/Green deployments, but the percentage of traffic sent to A/B testing is more or less based on the size of the deployments. With Istio, you could pretty much achieve all of this with purely service configurations, and setup many advanced rules. * Its not just about release strategies, Istio offers much more by extending existing awesome kubernetes features. It essentially offloads all the routing, traffic management configurations from developers by managing it all at the platform level.","title":"Lab K403 - Building Deployment Strategies"},{"location":"vote-deployement_strategies/#release-strategies","text":"","title":"Release Strategies"},{"location":"vote-deployement_strategies/#releases-with-downtime-using-recreate-strategy","text":"When the Recreate deployment strategy is used, * The old pods will be deleted * Then the new pods will be created.

This could be easily achieved with Kubernetes using the method described here. Canary needs more advanced configurations, typically lacking with kubernetes, and thats where you may want to consider using a service mesh such as Istio. cd k8s-code/projets/instavote/dev mkdir ab cp vote-deploy.yaml ab/vote-ab-deploy.yaml change the following fields in vote-ab-deploy.yaml metadata.name: vote-ab spec.replicas: 3 spec.selector.matchExpressions: - {key: version, operator: Exists template.metadata.labels.version: v4 template.spec.containers.image: schoolofdevops/vote:v4 File: ab/frontend-ab-deploy.yml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: vote-ab spec: strategy: type: RollingUpdate rollingUpdate: maxSurge: 2 maxUnavailable: 1 revisionHistoryLimit: 4 paused: false replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: role: vote matchExpressions: - {key: version, operator: Exists} minReadySeconds: 40 template: metadata: name: vote labels: app: python role: vote version: v4 spec: containers: - name: app image: schoolofdevops/vote:v4 ports: - containerPort: 80 protocol: TCP Before creating this deployment, find out how many endpoints the service has, kubectl describe service/vote [sample output ] Endpoints: 10.32.0.10:80,10.32.0.11:80,10.32.0.4:80 + 12 more...

If you see these services running, you have a working istio cluster with a sample app running on top of your kubernetes environment. Exposing bookinfo app from outside Istio has its own way of handling traffic and exposing it outside. Istio creates two difference resources which are equivalent of what kubernetes service offers.
