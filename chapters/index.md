# Kubernete Tutorials with CKA and CKAD Prep Guide 

Welcome to the Kubernetes Tutorial with CKA and CKAD Prep Guide  by School of Devops

This document was originally created as  a Lab Guide to go along with the [Kubernetes Course by School of Devops](http://www.schoolofdevops.com/). However, you could also use it on its own now to practice learning kubernetes topics.

If you still believe you could learn better and faster by audio visual means, definitely consider subscribing to our course at  [schoolofdevops.com](http://schoolofdevops.com).
